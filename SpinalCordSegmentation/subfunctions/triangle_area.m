function [area]=triangle_area(P,method)
% This function gives the area of a triangle
%
% [area]=triangle_area(Points, Method)
%
% Points: The Points should be a numeric array, of size 3xn, 
%         thus the points can be 2D, 3D... nD
% Method: Can be 'h' area calculation with Heron's formula 
%         or can be 'q' Orthogonal-triangular decomposition (default)
%
% Example: 
% P1=[0 0]; P2=[1 0.5]; P3=[0.5 1];
% area = triangle_area([P1;P2;P3])
%
% Version 1.1 updated on 2007-09-21 
% Added 'Orthogonal-triangular decomposition' after a usefull review of John D'Errico
